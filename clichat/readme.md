# Setting up the command-line chat

1. Register an account at PubNub (https://www.pubnub.com/)
2. Create a new project and a new keyset
3. Fill in the keys in chat.php
4. Run chmod +x chat.php. This makes chat.php executable
5. Run ./chat.php

If you're having trouble setting this up still, we run through the setup process in the series to help you understand the process better.
